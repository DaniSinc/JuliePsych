        <h2>Hello, I'm Julie<h2> 
        <div class="profile-para">
          <p class="text-justify">I know how difficult it is to find a therapist you can trust for help with your emotional and psychological difficulties. Sometimes our suffering is concealed from friends, family or colleagues because we are good at hiding it but deep inside, we are left feeling far from happy, fulfilled or content. At other times our difficulties are more noticeable. I am passionate about helping people live better lives. I help them discover what matters to them, what type of person they want to be and how they would like to behave. Once their values are clarified I help them make sustainable changes towards the things that are important to them.
          <br>
          <br> I see adolescents, adults and older adults with anxiety disorders (phobias, social anxiety, health anxiety, OCD, PTSD, panic attacks, GAD), depression (acute, chronic, SAD), personality disorders, bereavement, loss, abuse, neglect, anger and relationship problems. I have a particular interest in physical health conditions such as chronic pain and CFS.
          <br>
          <br> I am an experienced Clinical Psychologist with 15 years in the NHS. I believe in creating a trusting and compassionate environment where people can openly discuss their difficulties. I consider myself a kind, empathic and pragmatic therapist who works with integrity and treats confidentiality as paramount. I offer therapy either face to face or via Skype.</p>

    <hr>
    <p class="text-justify">I am a very experienced Clinical Psychologist (DClinPsy) and Chartered Psychologist (CPsychol) with over 15 years working in the area of mental health in the NHS. I gained proficiency in the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of patients with emotional and psychological difficulties whilst working in major hospitals and institutions in the London area; these include Imperial College NHS Trust, the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust and I am currently employed at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery.
    <br>
    <br>
    As part of my training, I am experienced in working with a variety of psychological models such as cognitive Behavioural therapies; Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Person Centred Approach, Narrative Therapy, Compassion Focused Therapy, Solution Focused Therapy and Mindfulness based cognitive therapy. I believe in being flexible and adjusting these approaches to best suit the person's needs according to their physical health, age, culture factors, psychological outlook and social environment. My focus is on empowering people to take an active part in the management of their health and to optimise their inner resources. Therapies may also involve skills acquisition such as assertiveness, communication, problem solving or conflict resolution training.</p>
